                        <p>Knowing how to solve the Rubik's Cube may not be a common skill but it's not so hard to learn if you practice. You don't have to be Albert Einstein to get it done so let's show you how.</p>
                        <p>In this tutorial we are going to use the easiest layer-by-layer method.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="grid-item" style="position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 155px;"><span>Step 1</span>
                    <div>
                        <div>
                            <h3>White Edges</h3>
                            <p>Let's start with the white face. Cube Oririentation is crucial. Having the white core on the bottom on the cube and the yellow core on the top of the cube at all times helps with knowing what colors needs to be moved where. Try to form a plus sign on the top of the cube, matching the colors of the side stickers to the colors of the lateral centers. This step shouldn't be too hard, try to do this without reading the examples below.</p>
                            <div class="centeralign"><img width="150" height="150" src="/Users/graphicslab/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/originals/6/66AAD2AC-7874-441E-AEA0-7B93269F4BD7.jpeg" alt="white edges correct way"></div>
                            <p>We can easily insert the white edges to the top if you imagine making a "daisy" with the yellow center on the bottom of the cube and white edges. From here you can match the side stickers one at a time, and turn them to make the white cross on the top.</p>
                            <div class="centeralign"><img width="150" height="150" src="/Users/graphicslab/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/originals/2/20E6C554-3A45-4291-9837-AB2D8CD63AFE.jpeg" alt="insert first edge"></div>
                            <table class="fullwidth">
                                <tbody>
                                    <tr>
                                        <td><strong>A</strong> - Yellow Daisy:</td>
                                    </tr>
                                </tbody>
                            </table>
                            <p>Below is an example of a "good" white cross:</p>

All actions are done clockwise, if a mark has an Apostrophe - ' - this means the action is counter-clockwise</p>

                    <div>
                        <div>
                            <h3>Finish The White Face</h3>
                            <p><img width="150" height="150" class="floatRight" src=" /Users/graphicslab/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/originals/9/9E387D1B-3589-4371-9418-7CC0636701AB.jpeg " alt="solve cube white corners">After we have gotten the cross and the edges are matching the color of thier "center" piece, we can move on to solve the white coners.</p>
                            <p>First take note of where the white peices are relative to the spots missing from the cross face. Again here remeber cube orientation. With the yellow core at the top we look for white corners in the top row. If a white piece is on the top row, the color peiece it is connected to on the side must be matched with its corresponding core color. There are two algorithms below  that can be used until the white piece comes to its desired destination.</p>
                            <p class="centeralign"><span class="algo"><span class="ri">R</span><span class="di">U</span><span class="r">R'</span><span class="d">U'</span></span></p>
                            <p class="centeralign"><span class="algo"><span class="ri">L</span><span class="di">U</span><span class="r">L'</span><span class="d">U'</span></span></p>
                            <p>These moves send the piece back and forth between the top and bottom locations, and is called a "trigger".  Triggers are the core moves you will use. Right triggers are made with the right hand and Left triggers are made with the left hand and are used in this stage based on the side of the cube the white piece is on after the color has been matched.
                                <img width="150" height="150" class="floatRight" src="/Users/graphicslab/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/originals/E/E224D910-4169-49E1-9A00-D46D6854DCC8.jpeg" alt="solved white face"></p>
                            <p>At the end your cube should have a solid white face with the lateral stickers matching the lateral centers. this should make a "T" shape</p>

                </div>

                <div class="grid-item" style="position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 1620px;"><span> Step 3</span>
                    <div>
                        <div>
                            <h3>Center Layer</h3>
                            <p>  In the orientation of the cube, the white face should be upside down because we don't need to work with the white face anymore. We can now start to work on the middle layer by lining up a Capital T and doing left or right triggers depending on which side and color you must line up: </p>
                            <p>  Once a Capital T is made, look for the color at the top of the cube. If it mathces a color to the left or right, detemine the color and turn the top section of the cube away from it. Depending on the direction turned, that is the trigger that must be perfomed. </p>
                            <p>  Once a trigger is performed in this stage, it was always displce a white piece from the bottom. To put that peice back, we do the same as if we are solving for the white face. This is repeated until the second layer is solved completely. </p>

                            <p>Inspect the top of your cube. You see a yellow cross, a line, an L-shape or a dot. Our goal is to form a yellow cross or a "fish" shape.</p>

                            <h3>Swap Edges</h3>
                            <p>We have a yellow cross or fish on the top but the edges are not in their final position. If you have a cross, line up the yellow edge peice in the top layers with your right hand and perform this modiefied trigger. If you have a fish shape, line up the fish to point to the bottom left corner of the top of the cube and perform this modiefied trigger.</p>
                            <p class="centeralign"><span class="algo"><span class="r">R</span><span class="u">U</span><span class="ri">R'</span><span class="u">U</span><span class="r">R</span><span class="u">U</span><span class="u">U</span><span class="ri">R'</span><span class="u">U</span></span></p>
                            <p>Use this to swap the front and left yellow edges in the top layer. This will result in a fully solved yellow face.</p>

                            <p>Only the top layer is left unsolved at this point. Now we are going to put the colors in their final position and we'll rotate them in the last step.</p>
                            <p>Use the algorithm below to cycle the pieces. To make this easier, find a left corner piece that matches the color of an entire face and line it up then do the algorithm. Once here you may also see the left side of the cube has a single peice that does not match. At this point you should also do the algorithm.</p>

                            <h3>Solving the Cube</h3>
                            <p>Everything is positioned, we just have to solve the rest of the cube. We use a new algorithm that fixes the displaced center piece of the top layer for all the sides. If there is one, Orient the side that has a solved face not including the white and yellow faces away from you and begin the algorithm. If there is no solved face then perform the algorithm until there is and follow the rule for orientation before doing the algorithm again.</p>

                            <p>This step can be confusing for most people so read the explanation very carefully and do exactly what it says!</p>

                             Repeat the algorithm until this piece is solved.<br>
                            <p><strong>Important!</strong> During the process it might seem that you have messed up the whole cube but don't worry because it will come together if you do it correctly, following the instructions. </p>
